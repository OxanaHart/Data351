    "- <input type=\"checkbox\" checked> merged trips data with fleetmaster to find out tareWeight of each bus. About 30% of info missing, checking with Hamish on this.\n",
    "- <input type=\"checkbox\" checked>created function that calculates emissions\n",
    "-<input type=\"checkbox\" checked> added the column to the data that calculates emissions\n",
    "- <input type=\"checkbox\" checked> need to add another calc for emissions for ELECTRIC bus, perhaps its just zero, did not have time to find out<input type=\"checkbox\" checked> \n",
    "- <input type=\"checkbox\" checked> Cleaned up data\n",
    "-  I think when we miss bus Tare weight, emissions calc becomes zero, therefore diluting true emissions size. Think how to fix this.\n",
    "- after the above is ironed out, need to aggregate the data per route per weekday and per hour of the day\n",
    "- next plot it\n",

    "- <input type=\"checkbox\" checked> plotted the data in 4 plots: 2 for emissions value on weekdays and weekends and 2 for emissiona savings on weekdays and weekends.\n",
    "- <input type=\"checkbox\" checked> option 1) scatterplot with a dot per trip. COnsidering there are million+ records, a lot fo dots are hidden behild other dots?\n",
    "- <input type=\"checkbox\" checked>option 2) Inomved y scale to go by hour\n",
    "- <input type=\"checkbox\" checked>option 3) aggregated data by route, start time and weekday.\n",
    " - there are 900+ unique Stat Times, so perhaps we will need to aggregate by hour after all.\n",
    "- created some basic interactive plots to attempt exporting them out of python. Exporting is a complicated step and I read a few articles about it, but have not figured out. \n",
    "- Most imporant next step is to figure out how to explort any plot with interactive functionality out of pyton environment"
